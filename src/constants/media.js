// Place your hosted video URLs here.
// You can use a direct link to an MP4 (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary) or a local path if needed (though local large files are hard to git push).

// Example: "https://your-cdn.com/videos/lobby-presentation.mp4"
export const LOBBY_VIDEO_URL = "/src/assets/videos/lobby.mp4"; // Defaulting to local for now, REPLACE THIS with your URL.
